#Blackjack matplotlib

## Background

I have an addictive personality and a love of graphs. So, when I ordered the world's cheapest poker set to play with my friends, I also wanted to try out playing blackjack. I played a few games and wrote down the my current total chips after each hand so that I could eventually turn it into a sort of graph. Then, a few months later, I realised that I have some basic python skills and could probably just make a program that creates that graph from a blackjack game that I coded, so thats what this is. :)

## Requirements to run this program

In order to utilise this program, you need to use the [pip](https://pypi.org/project/pip/) installer and ensure that you have the following packages installed:
```
- matplotlib
- random
- time
```
